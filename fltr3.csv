   abg and change back to PS after road trip....feel that fatigue is
   likely from volume, needs to mobilize fluid
   making increased urine output,
   no urine eos and compelemnts low,
   zosyn for uti
   bone scan today for hip pain
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hyptotesnion,  in ICU with pseudomal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, hypotension, ARF and respiratory failure
    >  Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but
   is total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation,
   given some improved urine output today will likely begin auto-diuresis
   phase of ATN, will follow u/o and consider gentle diuresis later today
   with goal even to negative 500 today prior to extubation
                  continue PS and lighten sedation with SBT in am
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving
        WBC trending down, hemodynamically stable, porta cath without
   fluid by u/s and low suspicion of seeding given GNRs rather than GPCs
         L hip pain remains problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] for possible met/lytic lesion or
   fx, no evidence of fluid for tap to suggest septic bursitis/source for
   infection
         Continue zosyn X 14 day course and  f/u cx results
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension, now rate controlled  and stable hemodynamically off of
   pressors
       suspect that the dopr in BP secondary to preload dependance
        With severe AS rather than  persistent spesis, now starting to
   autodiurese, would match i/o's as is very preload dependant also in
   setting of positive pressure, would allow autodiuresis and consider
   diruestics later, for goal even to negative fluid balnace
         cvp difficult to follow given severe AS
         lactates normalized
         follow MAPs and u/o
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)- reverted back to NSR with ectopy and
   paroxysmal---now rate controlled, on dig, responsive to IVFs but would
   avoid calcium channel blockers in setting of RVR given severe AS, Daily
   stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given low plts
   at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture improves as may
   remain in chronic a- fib,
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr appears to have peaked and now with increasing u/o--will likely
   start to auto-diurese
        continue phos binder

   improvement
             continue  zosyn for pseudomonas
             clinically improving and highest  suspicion remains of
   urosepsis
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,
   check smear
   follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin products
   for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 AORTIC STENOSIS--severe, preload dependent as above
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)--pseudomonas, pan sensitive--continue
   zosyn as above X 14 day course

   Microbiology: urine cx --2 pan sensitive pseudomonas
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
        Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis
   but is total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to
   extubation, urine output continues to improve and  will likely begin
   auto-diuresis phase of ATN, is likely somewhat preload dependant and in
   setting of positive pressure though at risk for significant flash pulm
   edema post extubation and resultant ischemia
             follow u/o and consider gentle diuresis later today (lasix,
   thiazide)
                    would change back to PS later  and follow abg though
   not ready for extubation
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts, though WBC elevated, all counts are up
   and would trend
          Infection work up as previously noted, following all cx
          Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation
   though recently hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in
   setting of positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese,
         follow MAPs and u/o and consider gentle diuretics later
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)- reverted back to NSR, with ectopy
      Continue dig
       Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr appears to have peaked and now with increasing u/o--will likely
   start to auto-diurese
        continue phos binder
        all meds renally dosed
   >  Leukocytosis
up slightly along with all cell counts
trend, no
   diarrhea and c diff neg and appropriate antibx coverage in place,
   follow and continue  zosyn for pseudomonas
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely
        follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin
   products for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)--pseudomonas, pan sensitive--continue
   zosyn as above X 14 day course
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection but given her significant
   pain concern for some lytic lesion/fx or micro fx or bony mets-- bone

   now at baseline--follow for further reduction from baseline, continue
   heparin products for now given low suspicion for HIT
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, limited

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Microbiology: Urine cx - pseudomonas, no sensi
   Blood cx - NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage/double coverage of pseudomonas
     Recheck abg for Ph/CO2 and lactate
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)- psuedomonal urospesis also
   likely with asp pna--improving --off pressors with additional fluid
   resuscitation, wbc trending down
      L hip pain remains problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] though no obvious fluid collection on
   imaging, pain with touch, motion on exam--? septic brusitis, ortho
   following and await additonal recs
     continue zosynm f/u cx's
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of afib with RVR and
   hypotension, now rate controlled
   BP improved, sdtable and off of pressors, cvp difficult to follow given
   severe AS, lactates normalized
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   renal follwoing, atn from sepsis hypotension, cr seems to have peaked,
   phos binder started, all meds renally dosed
   thrombocytopenia--on review of records baseline thromnbocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with intial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration,
   dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely, check smear, component of
   hemoconcetration likely though HIT possibiloty but given that plt is
   now at baseline--follow for further reduction from baseline, continue
   heparin products for now given low suspicion for HIT
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, limited
   given her severe af, respnsive to IVFs but would avoid calcium channel
   blockers,  given new drop in hct and plts
     Leukocytosis--improving toward normal, check dc diff, continue vacno
   X 24 more hrs given catheter, clinically improving and highest
   suspicion is of urosepsis, though with line in plae would check
   ultrasound of porta cath and await new cx gram stain and result to show
   no GPs

 URINE CULTURE - At [**2163-1-18**] 03:39 PM
   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, responsive
   to IVFs but would avoid calcium channel blockers in setting of RVR

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection, cholecystitis, etc.
   though she has a benign abd exam and negative cultures from her
   indwelling line.
   - Will get repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues to need pressors, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management.
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Likely ATN, though
   creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delerium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
           continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in next
   1-2 days after additional diuresis
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
          Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing
   improvement in creatinine, start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
         Continue phos binder and renal dosing of emds
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving
           Complete  zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of
   positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese and will give lasix and thiazide today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
      Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
   >  thrombocytopenia--baseline thrombocytopenia in 50-70 range, with
   initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration and now likely at
   baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,  follow for further
   reduction from baseline, continue heparin products for now given low
   suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable, transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if
   hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection, given pain have further

        diurese, continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in
   next 1-2 days
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts,
           Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean, though has been diuresing well
   Active issues remains:
   > Respiratory failure
doing well w/ minimal vent support, alert and
   following commands, rsbi 50's and diuresing nicely.  CXR essentially
   stable with chronic changes at R base (h/o R pleurodesis)
          Check abg on PS 5/5 and if remains stable would extubate.
   Consider trial of NPPV if problems with oxygenation/chf post
   extubation
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
         Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing
   improvement in creatinine
         Continue thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L negative as BP
   tolerates)
         Continue phos binder and renal dosing of meds
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   resolved

 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
              mobilizing fluids, continue dig, BP stable
              continue diuresis
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
             appears nsr now with ectopy
 check 12 lead
             Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
   >  thrombocytopenia--baseline thrombocytopenia in 50-70 range, with
   initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration and now appears at
   baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,  follow for further
   reduction from baseline, continue heparin products for now given low
   suspicion for HIT, recheck plt later today given slight decrease from
   51-47
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable, transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if
   hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
        Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection, given pain have

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - Continue Zosyn, add additional gram negative coverage (will d/w ID)
   - Follow up culture data
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Likely GU source, but
   portacath and hip are also very possible sources. Currently on
   Levophed, clinically requires additional fluid challenge.
   - Broaden GNR coverage (as above), also add Vanco for gram positives.
   - Place A-line for hemodynamic monitoring
   - Will consider further imaging of hip
   - Fluid boluses
   - Consider dobutamine if SVO2 remains low
   * Afib: new, likely related to acute illness, levophed
   - Attempt to wean levophed
   - Hold off on anticoag for now
   - Obtain 12-lead EKG
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   * Nausea/vomiting: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to dilaudid, ruling out cardiac
   etiology
   - Zofran PRN
   - Cycle enzymes

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - Continue Zosyn, add additional gram negative coverage (will d/w ID)
   - Follow up culture data
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Likely GU source, but
   portacath and hip are also very possible sources.
   If worsening, increased pressor needs consider porta cath removal
    Currently on Levophed, clinically requires additional fluid challenge.
   - Broaden GNR coverage (as above), also add Vanco for gram positives.
   - Place A-line for hemodynamic monitoring
   - Will consider further imaging of hip when stable for MRI or CT,
   concern for infection or pathologic fx given pain
   - Consider dobutamine if SVO2 remains low
recheck after additional IVF
   boluses
   * Afib: new, likely related to acute illness, levophed
   - Attempt to wean levophed
   - Hold off on anticoag for now
   - Obtain 12-lead EKG
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   * Nausea/vomiting: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to dilaudid, ruling out cardiac
   etiology
   - Zofran PRN
   - Cycle enzymes
